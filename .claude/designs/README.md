# Feature Designs

This directory contains architecture and design documents for features in this application.

## Purpose

Design documents help:
- Plan features before implementation
- Document architectural decisions
- Share context with the team and AI assistants
- Track the evolution of the system

## Creating a Design

Use the `/design-feature` command to create a new design document. This will guide you through:
1. Gathering requirements
2. Defining architecture
3. Creating API contracts
4. Planning implementation

## Design Template

Each design document should include:

- **Overview**: What is this feature?
- **User Story**: Who needs it and why?
- **Architecture**: Database, API, frontend changes
- **API Contracts**: TypeScript types for requests/responses
- **Implementation Steps**: How to build it
- **Open Questions**: What's undecided?

## Example Designs

See existing designs in this directory for examples of well-documented features.
